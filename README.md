TelegramAlert allows you to send [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org) alert messages to a specified [Telegram](https://telegram.org) chat.

## Requirements

Requires Graylog 2.4 or later. It's recommended to use the [latest Graylog release](https://www.graylog.org/products/latestversion).

## Installation

1. Download the [latest TelegramAlert release](https://github.com/irgendwr/TelegramAlert/releases/latest)
and place the `telegram-alert-x.x.x.jar` file in your `plugin_dir` that is configured in your `graylog.conf`
as described in the [Graylog documentation](http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/pages/plugins.html#installing-and-loading-plugins).

2. Restart your graylog-server, i.e. `service graylog-server restart`.

3. Configure an alert notification as described in the next section.

## Usage

### Step 1 - Create Bot

Create a new Telegram bot with the [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the bot token.

### Step 2 - Get Channel ID

Use the [Message Tool](https://irgendwr.github.io/TelegramAlert/message-tool) to find the **Chat ID** of the desired chat.

You can use a private chat, add the bot to a group-chat or to a channel. Just make sure to copy the correct Channel ID.

### Step 3 - Add Alert Notification

Add a new alert notification in your Graylog-interface and select `Telegram Alert` as the notification type.

The message is a template that can be configured as described in the [Graylog Documentation](http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/pages/streams/alerts.html#email-alert-notification)
